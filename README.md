### Bot logic
1. Initializes logging. Logging is implemented by simple writing in a file.
2. Processes chat IDs file. Chat ids are needed to write message to users.
    1. If there is a file, program will parse it. It will save all IDs from a file, in a list.
    2. If there is no such file, program will create it.
3. Runs bot listener for updates (user messages). All messages goes there and are procesed by `processUpdate(Update update)` method.
4. Runs infinite loop in a new thread, which checks for a website availability. If website status changes, all users from a `chatIds` list get an update.
